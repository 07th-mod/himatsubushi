> This repository **only** hosts the script files and a few voice files needed to fix bugs, check our [wiki](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/Higurashi-Getting-started) for instructions on how to install the patch!

This patch aims to combine the efforts of the PS3 voice patch and the PS3 sprites/background patch, and fill in missing voice files not covered by the original voice patch.

This repository is in constant change. Sometimes new releases might get on hold until there is enough content to push a new patch. If the latest patch has a bug that seems to be already fixed in the repository, try downloading the master file. The master file will always have the latest files, regardless of the current release being outdated or not.

# Known issues

> in omake_04.txt, the last few minutes of text are lacking many voices. In the PS3 version, they have been changed to a completely different text and new content has been added.
